  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes ARC-Top-K, an All-Reduce compatible Top-K compressor that aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using gradient sketches to enable efficient communication. This method preserves globally significant gradient information while maintaining the contraction property and compatibility with All-Reduce operations. Empirical results show it matches Top-K accuracy while reducing training time by up to 60.7%, combining Rand-K's robustness with Top-K's performance.
