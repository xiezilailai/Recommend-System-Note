  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a new probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure model that integrates with the Analysis component of MAPE-K based self-protecting systems. The model mathematically analyzes system behavior under attack-recovery dynamics using Markov processes and provides simulation results. The approach enables distributed systems to autonomously manage security threats through dynamic self-protection and reconfiguration strategies.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04631
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces dynamic concurrency, a method that uses strong synchronization primitives only when operations must arbitrate based on the current system state. It presents a dynamically concurrent universal construction that avoids consensus-based synchronization when operations don't conflict in the current state. The approach improves scalability by reducing unnecessary synchronization in distributed systems.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04268
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a novel parallel spawning strategy for MPI applications where all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution, reducing execution time and enabling better resource adaptation. The method overcomes limitations of existing approaches by allowing full release of unneeded processes during shrink operations while maintaining competitive expansion performance. The strategy achieves up to 1.25× overhead for expansion and reduces shrink operation costs by at least 20×, validated on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03866
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces OMPILOT, a domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer model that translates C++ code to OpenMP for shared-memory parallelization. It uses custom pre-training objectives combining unsupervised and supervised learning to operate at function level rather than just loop level. The approach demonstrates improved robustness in code translation and introduces OMPBLEU, a specialized metric for evaluating OpenMP parallel constructs.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents JUQCS-50, a quantum computer simulator that achieves 50-qubit simulations using three key innovations: extending memory beyond GPU limits through CPU-GPU interconnects and LPDDR5 memory, adaptive data encoding to reduce memory footprint, and network traffic optimization. These methods resulted in an 11.4-fold speedup over previous 48-qubit simulations, demonstrating efficient large-scale quantum circuit simulation on Europe's first exascale supercomputer.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04489
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte Carlo algorithm implemented in a new open-source code called Eiron for nuclear fusion simulations. The domain decomposition approach outperforms existing parallel algorithms in scaling tests and enables simulations that were previously impossible due to memory constraints. The method achieved superlinear strong scaling on grids exceeding L3 cache size and scaled efficiently to 16,384 cores.
