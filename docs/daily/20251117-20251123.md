- **[arXiv251117] Cascading Bandits With Feedback**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [cascade bandits, explore-then-commit, action elimination, lower confidence bound, thompson sampling]
  - **authors:** R Sri Prakash, Nikhil Karamchandani, Sharayu Moharir
  - **institution:** IIITDM Kancheepuram, IIT Bombay
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10938
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper analyzes four decision-making policies for cascade bandits in edge inference systems. The study shows that LCB and Thompson Sampling achieve constant regret by continuously adapting based on feedback, while Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret due to fixed ordering commitments. Adaptive policies are crucial for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** SemanticNN is a semantic codec system that tolerates bit-level transmission errors while maintaining semantic-level correctness for device-edge collaborative inference. It uses BER-aware decoders, soft quantization encoders, and novel training strategies to handle asymmetric resources. Experimental results show it reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy under varying error rates.

- **[arXiv251117] HPCAgentTester: A Multi-Agent LLM Approach for Enhanced HPC Unit Test Generation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [multi-agent LLM, OpenMP, MPI, unit test generation, parallel computing, critique loop]
  - **authors:** Rabimba Karanjai, Lei Xu, Weidong Shi
  - **institution:** University of Houston, Kent State University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10860
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a multi-agent LLM framework that uses specialized agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) working collaboratively through a critique loop to generate unit tests for HPC software. The system produces compilable and functionally correct tests targeting parallel execution constructs in OpenMP and MPI. Evaluation shows it significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, effectively identifying subtle bugs in parallel software systems.

- **[arXiv251117] A Unified Convergence Analysis for Semi-Decentralized Learning: Sampled-to-Sampled vs. Sampled-to-All Communication**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [federated learning, semi-decentralized learning, local SGD, device-to-device communication, model aggregation, convergence analysis]
  - **authors:** Angelo Rodio, Giovanni Neglia, Zheng Chen, Erik G. Larsson
  - **institution:** Linköping University, Inria
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11560
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper analyzes two communication strategies (sampled-to-sampled vs sampled-to-all) in semi-decentralized federated learning where devices primarily use device-to-device communication with periodic server interactions. The authors develop a unified convergence framework that accounts for sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Their analysis reveals that the optimal strategy depends primarily on data heterogeneity across devices, providing practical design guidelines for semi-decentralized FL deployments.
