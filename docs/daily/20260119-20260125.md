- **[arXiv260119] Konflux: Optimized Function Fusion for Serverless Applications**
  - **tags:** [sys], [serverless computing], [function fusion, FaaS, cost optimization, latency optimization, emulation, brute-force analysis]
  - **authors:** Niklas Kowallik, Trever Schirmer, David Bermbach
  - **institution:** TU Berlin
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11156
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents Konflux, a system that emulates FaaS platforms to locally analyze all possible function fusion configurations for serverless applications. It finds that only a limited set of these configurations are optimal for balancing cost and latency, and this optimal set is heavily dependent on the specific cloud pricing model.

- **[arXiv260119] AFLL: Real-time Load Stabilization for MMO Game Servers Based on Circular Causality Learning**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [backpropagation, gradient descent, real-time adaptive control, circular causality learning, feedback loop, message throttling]
  - **authors:** Shinsuk Kang, Youngjae Kim
  - **institution:** Sogang University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10998
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes AFLL, a real-time load stabilization system for MMO game servers that uses backpropagation to learn the causal relationship between outgoing messages and incoming client requests. By dynamically adjusting message transmission weights, it proactively throttles low-priority traffic to prevent server overload. The system significantly reduced CPU time and thread contention in experiments, demonstrating that circular causality learning enables effective real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems.

- **[arXiv260119] A Survey of Real-Time Support, Analysis, and Advancements in ROS 2**
  - **tags:** [sys], [real-time systems], [DDS, executors, publish-subscribe, timing analysis, micro-ROS]
  - **authors:** Daniel Casini, Jian-Jia Chen, Jing Li, Federico Reghenzani, Harun Teper
  - **institution:** Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna, TU Dortmund University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Politecnico di Milano
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10722
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This survey provides a comprehensive overview of research efforts to analyze and enhance the real-time capabilities of ROS 2, focusing on its scheduling mechanisms, communication middleware, and timing analysis. It reviews key contributions, including new executor designs and techniques for bounding communication delays, and introduces taxonomies to classify the work. The paper aims to guide researchers and practitioners in understanding and improving the timing predictability of ROS 2 for real-time robotic applications.

- **[arXiv260119] Space-Optimal, Computation-Optimal, Topology-Agnostic, Throughput-Scalable Causal Delivery through Hybrid Buffering**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed systems], [causal delivery, SPS+FIFO, hybrid buffering, topology-agnostic, metadata overhead]
  - **authors:** Paulo Sérgio Almeida
  - **institution:** INESC TEC, University of Minho
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11487
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces a novel algorithm for causal message delivery in distributed systems by combining sender-buffering to enforce Sender Permission to Send (SPS) and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO order. This hybrid approach achieves effectively constant metadata size per message and amortized constant processing overhead, overcoming the scalability and liveness limitations of prior sender-only buffering methods. The authors conclude it is the first topology-agnostic causal delivery algorithm with these space-optimal and computation-optimal properties.
