- **[arXiv260126] Consensus In Asynchrony**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed consensus], [events-based synchronisation, vector agreement, fault-tolerant, deterministic consensus, FLP impossibility, binary agreement]
  - **authors:** Ivan Klianev

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19092
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces Axe Layout, a unified hardware-aware abstraction that maps logical tensor coordinates to a multi-axis physical space to unify tiling, sharding, and replication across inter-device and on-device layouts. It also presents a distribution-aware DSL and compiler built on this abstraction. Experiments show this unified approach achieves performance close to hand-tuned kernels across various GPU devices, multi-device environments, and accelerator backends.
