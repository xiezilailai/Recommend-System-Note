- **[arXiv260126] Consensus In Asynchrony**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed consensus], [events-based synchronisation, vector agreement, fault-tolerant, deterministic consensus, FLP impossibility, binary agreement]
  - **authors:** Ivan Klianev
  - **institution:** Transactum Pty Ltd
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16460
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a deterministic fault-tolerant consensus algorithm for asynchronous systems using events-based synchronization, which achieves termination with valid vector agreement. It reconciles this result with the FLP impossibility theorem by identifying two types of agreements and three implicit assumptions in FLP, arguing that one critical assumption lacks empirical support.

- **[arXiv260126] Space Filling Curves is All You Need: Communication-Avoiding Matrix Multiplication Made Simple**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [GPU kernels], [space filling curves, communication-avoiding algorithms, generalized Hilbert curves, matrix multiplication, GEMM]
  - **authors:** Evangelos Georganas, Alexander Heinecke, Pradeep Dubey
  - **institution:** Intel Corporation
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16294
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes using space filling curves, specifically generalized Hilbert curves, to partition matrix multiplication computations, achieving platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious schemes with high data locality. It extends this approach to communication-avoiding algorithms that minimize data movement, resulting in compact code that outperforms vendor libraries by up to 2x on various CPU platforms.

- **[arXiv260126] Artifact for Service-Level Energy Modeling and Experimentation for Cloud-Native Microservices**
  - **tags:** [sys], [cloud computing], [Kubernetes, Kepler, cAdvisor, additive energy model, service-level measurement]
  - **authors:** Julian Legler
  - **institution:** Technische Universität Berlin
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16635
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents GOXN, an experimentation engine for measuring the energy consumption of Kubernetes-based microservices, which uses an additive model to derive service-level energy from container-level data collected via tools like Kepler and cAdvisor. The main conclusion is that excluding network and storage energy can lead to significant underestimation of consumption, particularly for auxiliary services, and that high tracing loads shift energy dominance toward network and storage.

- **[arXiv260126] GPU-Accelerated Selected Basis Diagonalization with Thrust for SQD-based Algorithms**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [GPU kernels], [Selected Basis Diagonalization, Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, Thrust library, Davidson method, GPU acceleration, data-parallel primitives]
  - **authors:** Jun Doi, Tomonori Shirakawa, Yukio Kawashima, Seiji Yunoki, Hiroshi Horii
  - **institution:** IBM Quantum, RIKEN
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16637
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a GPU-accelerated implementation of Selected Basis Diagonalization (SBD) for Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) algorithms using the Thrust library. By restructuring key components into fine-grained, data-parallel operations and GPU-friendly data layouts, the method achieves up to ~40x speedup over CPU execution. The results demonstrate that GPU-native parallel primitives provide a high-performance foundation for accelerating quantum-classical workflows.

- **[arXiv260126] DataStates-LLM: Scalable Checkpointing for Transformer Models Using Composable State Providers**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm training], [checkpointing, state providers, asynchronous snapshots, hybrid parallelism, data parallelism, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, ZeRO, FSDP]
  - **authors:** Avinash Maurya, M. Mustafa Rafique, Franck Cappello, Bogdan Nicolae
  - **institution:** Argonne National Laboratory, Rochester Institute of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16956
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces DataStates-LLM, a scalable checkpointing architecture that uses composable State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement and perform lazy, non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. It addresses the "3D heterogeneity" of distributed model states in large-scale LLM training. The evaluation shows it achieves up to 4x higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2x compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

- **[arXiv260126] W4A16 Mixed-Precision Matrix Multiplication on Decoupled Architecture: Kernel Design and Memory Bottleneck Analysis for Ascend NPUs**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [weight-only quantization, W4A16, matrix multiplication kernel, decoupled architecture, vector cores, cube cores, Split-K parallelization, on-the-fly dequantization]
  - **authors:** Yuanhong He, Peiyu Niu, Jun Chen, Chenchen Zhang, Chao Yang
  - **institution:** PKU-Changsha Institute of Computing and Digital Economy, Peking University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16536
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper designs a custom W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel for Huawei's Ascend 910 NPU, utilizing vector cores for dequantization and cube cores for computation with Split-K parallelization. It finds that the method achieves speedups, particularly in LLM decoding scenarios where K &gt;&gt; N. The main bottleneck is identified as the extra global memory transfer for weights, limiting the maximum speedup over FP16 to 1.48x.
