- **[arXiv260126] Consensus In Asynchrony**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed consensus], [events-based synchronisation, vector agreement, fault-tolerant, deterministic consensus, FLP impossibility, binary agreement]
  - **authors:** Ivan Klianev

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19092
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces Axe Layout, a unified hardware-aware abstraction that maps logical tensor coordinates to a multi-axis physical space to unify tiling, sharding, and replication across inter-device and on-device layouts. It also presents a distribution-aware DSL and compiler built on this abstraction. Experiments show this unified approach achieves performance close to hand-tuned kernels across various GPU devices, multi-device environments, and accelerator backends.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [energy measurement, GPU utilization, memory usage, throughput per watt, inference optimization]
  - **authors:** Jae-Won Chung, Ruofan Wu, Jeff J. Ma, Mosharaf Chowdhury
  - **institution:** University of Michigan, The ML.ENERGY Initiative
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22076
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of inference energy consumption across 46 generative AI models and 7 tasks, revealing order-of-magnitude variations. Based on these findings, the authors develop a framework for diagnosing energy use by linking it to latent metrics like memory and hardware utilization across algorithm, software, and hardware layers.

- **[arXiv260130] Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm training], [multi-agent reinforcement learning, actor-critic, decentralized collaboration, centralized critic, decentralized critics, monte carlo methods]
  - **authors:** Shuo Liu, Tianle Chen, Ryan Amiri, Christopher Amato
  - **institution:** Northeastern University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21972
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods, specifically CoLLM-CC and CoLLM-DC, to optimize decentralized collaboration among LLMs. It finds that while simpler methods work for short-horizon tasks, the centralized critic approach (CoLLM-CC) is superior for long-horizon or sparse-reward scenarios where decentralized critics and Monte Carlo methods struggle.

  - **institution:** Yale University, Nanyang Technological University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22124
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces Fed-MedLoRA, a federated and parameter-efficient framework for adapting large language models (LLMs) to medical applications by transmitting only low-rank adapter parameters to reduce overhead. It further proposes Fed-MedLoRA+ with data-aware aggregation to handle cross-site data heterogeneity. The framework demonstrates effectiveness in clinical information extraction tasks across multiple patient cohorts.

- **[arXiv260130] Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [operational intensity, capacity footprint, heterogeneous computing, disaggregated serving, KV cache, memory capacity wall, roofline analysis, optical I/O]
  - **authors:** Yiren Zhao, Junyi Liu
  - **institution:** Imperial College London, Microsoft Research
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22001
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces two metrics, Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF), to analyze AI agent inference workloads and identify bottlenecks like memory capacity. It argues that the diverse requirements of agentic workflows necessitate system-level heterogeneity, including specialized accelerators and disaggregated compute and memory. The main conclusion is that heterogeneous computing, through hardware co-design and disaggregation, is essential for scaling efficient and capable large-scale AI agent inference.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [cluster infrastructure], [multiple imputation, MICE, Apache Spark, big data, memory efficiency]
  - **authors:** Hugo Morvan, Jonas Agholme, Bjorn Eliasson, Katarina Olofsson, Ludger Grote, Fredrik Iredahl, Oleg Sysoev
  - **institution:** Linköping University, Göteborg University, Region Västra Götaland
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21613
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces the bigMICE package, which adapts the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) method for big data using Apache Spark to improve memory efficiency and processing speed. It demonstrates that this implementation can handle large datasets on limited hardware and produce high-quality imputations even with high proportions of missing data. The main conclusion is that bigMICE is more memory-efficient and faster on large datasets compared to traditional MICE implementations.
