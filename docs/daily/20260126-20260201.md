- **[arXiv260126] Consensus In Asynchrony**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed consensus], [events-based synchronisation, vector agreement, fault-tolerant, deterministic consensus, FLP impossibility, binary agreement]
  - **authors:** Ivan Klianev

  - **institution:** Sea AI Lab, National University of Singapore
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19362

This approach reduces synchronization barriers and improves load balancing for workloads with imbalanced sequence lengths, which are common in LLM post-training. The method consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving speedups of up to 36% over standard FSDP.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19647
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm that uses GPU ray tracing and tensor cores to build a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances, discarding interior points. The method accelerates 3D convex hull computation by up to 200x compared to a CPU parallel implementation while maintaining controlled energy consumption. The results demonstrate significant speed and energy efficiency benefits for high-performance geometric processing.

  - **institution:** The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19563
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a microservice-based framework for deploying foundation models at the edge, using a two-tier strategy with statically placed core services and dynamically orchestrated light services to ensure robust QoS. It employs a network-aware integer program for static deployment and an online controller integrating effective capacity theory with Lyapunov optimization for dynamic orchestration. The framework achieves over 84% on-time task completion with moderate cost and maintains robustness under scaling system loads.

  - **institution:** Carnegie Mellon University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, NVIDIA, Princeton University, University of Toronto
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19092
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces Axe Layout, a unified hardware-aware abstraction that maps logical tensor coordinates to a multi-axis physical space to unify tiling, sharding, and replication across inter-device and on-device layouts. It also presents a distribution-aware DSL and compiler built on this abstraction. Experiments show this unified approach achieves performance close to hand-tuned kernels across various GPU devices, multi-device environments, and accelerator backends.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19714
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents RICK 2.0, a radio astronomy imaging software that uses the HeFFTe library for distributed Fast Fourier Transforms to achieve high performance and portability across CPU and GPU architectures. The new implementation significantly reduces communication overheads that previously dominated runtime, enabling efficient scaling for large datasets. Validation with MeerKAT and LOFAR data shows it is a scalable solution ready for the SKA era.
