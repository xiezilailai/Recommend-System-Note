- **[arXiv260216] DRAMatic Speedup: Accelerating HE Operations on a Processing-in-Memory System**
  - **tags:** [sys], [hardware acceleration], [processing-in-memory, residue number system, number-theoretic transform, homomorphic encryption]
  - **authors:** Niklas Klinger, Jonas Sander, Peterson Yuhala, Pascal Felber, Thomas Eisenbarth
  - **institution:** University of Luebeck, University of Neuchâtel
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12433
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents DRAMatic, a system that implements foundational homomorphic encryption operations on UPMEM's Processing-in-Memory hardware to accelerate memory-bound computations. The evaluation shows DRAMatic significantly closes the performance gap with a conventional software library (Microsoft SEAL) but is limited by the PIM hardware's multiplication performance and data transfer overhead.

- **[arXiv260216] Bloom Filter Look-Up Tables for Private and Secure Distributed Databases in Web3 (Revised Version)**
  - **tags:** [sys], [decentralized systems], [Bloom Filter, BFLUT, OrbitDB, IPFS, IPNS, key management]
  - **authors:** Shlomi Dolev, Ehud Gudes, Daniel Shlomo
  - **institution:** Ben-Gurion University of the Negev
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13167
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a decentralized database scheme for secure key management in Web3, using the BFLUT algorithm to encode and distribute cryptographic keys without explicit storage. The system leverages OrbitDB, IPFS, and IPNS to ensure security, privacy, and scalability. The findings demonstrate that this approach can securely manage keys and prevent unauthorized access, providing a foundational solution for decentralized applications.

- **[arXiv260216] Distance-based certification for leader election in meshed graphs and local recognition of their subclasses**
  - **tags:** [sys], [graph theory], [proof labeling scheme, leader election, meshed graphs, distance verification, local certification]
  - **authors:** Jérémie Chalopin, Victor Chepoi, Maria Kokkou
  - **institution:** Aix-Marseille Université, Université Côte d'Azur
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12894
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents a 2-local proof labeling scheme using constant-size labels \{0,1,2\} to solve leader election in anonymous meshed graphs by locally verifying distances modulo 3 to a designated root. It also provides 3-local proof labeling schemes to recognize various subclasses of meshed graphs using labels of size O(log D). The main conclusion is that these local certification schemes efficiently verify global properties in important graph classes from metric graph theory.

- **[arXiv260216] OptiML: An End-to-End Framework for Program Synthesis and CUDA Kernel Optimization**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [GPU kernels], [Monte Carlo Tree Search, Mixture-of-Thoughts, Nsight Compute, program synthesis, search under verification]
  - **authors:** Arijit Bhattacharjee, Heng Ping, Son Vu Le, Paul Bogdan, Nesreen K. Ahmed, Ali Jannesari
  - **institution:** Iowa State University, University of Southern California, Cisco AI Research
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12305
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** OptiML is an end-to-end framework that synthesizes and optimizes CUDA kernels using a two-stage approach: a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator for initial code from natural language, followed by a search-based optimizer using Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by hardware-aware profiler feedback. It formulates kernel optimization as a search under verification, compiling and profiling each candidate transformation. The results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines.

- **[arXiv260216] Classification of Local Optimization Problems in Directed Cycles**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed algorithms], [LOCAL model, optimization, cycles, meta-algorithms, log-star complexity]
  - **authors:** Thomas Boudier, Fabian Kuhn, Augusto Modanese, Ronja Stimpert, Jukka Suomela
  - **institution:** GSSI, University of Freiburg, CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Aalto University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13046
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper provides a complete classification of the distributed computational complexity for local optimization problems in directed cycles, showing that any constant-factor approximation falls into one of four deterministic and randomized complexity classes. The authors develop an efficient centralized meta-algorithm to automatically determine the complexity class for any given problem and approximation ratio. The main conclusion is that these problems have complexities of either O(1), Θ(log* n), or Θ(n) rounds, and optimal distributed algorithms can be synthesized based on the classification.
