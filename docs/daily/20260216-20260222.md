- **[arXiv260218] Tight Communication Bounds for Distributed Algorithms in the Quantum Routing Model**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed computing], [quantum routing, quantum walks, electric networks, message complexity, leader election, broadcast, MST, BFS]
  - **authors:** Fabien Dufoulon, Frédéric Magniez, Gopal Pandurangan
  - **institution:** Lancaster University, Université Paris Cité, University of Houston
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15529
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces new distributed quantum algorithms for fundamental problems like leader election and MST, using quantum walks based on electric networks to reduce communication. It shows that these algorithms achieve near-optimal message complexities of Õ(n) or Õ(√mn), providing a quadratic advantage over classical lower bounds in the quantum routing model.

- **[arXiv260218] FlashMem: Supporting Modern DNN Workloads on Mobile with GPU Memory Hierarchy Optimizations**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [GPU kernels], [memory streaming, weight preloading, 2.5D texture memory, multi-model co-running, on-device inference]
  - **authors:** Zhihao Shu, Md Musfiqur Rahman Sanim, Hangyu Zheng, Kunxiong Zhu, Miao Yin, Gagan Agrawal, Wei Niu
  - **institution:** University of Georgia, University of Texas at Arlington
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15379
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** FlashMem is a memory streaming framework that statically schedules and dynamically streams model weights on demand for mobile GPU inference, instead of fully preloading them. It leverages 2.5D texture memory to reduce data transformations. The method achieves significant memory reduction and speedup, enabling efficient execution of large-scale and multi-DNN workloads on resource-constrained mobile devices.

- **[arXiv260218] On the Geometric Coherence of Global Aggregation in Federated GNN**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [federated learning, graph neural networks, geometric coherence, global aggregation, cross-domain federated learning, GGRS]
  - **authors:** Chethana Prasad Kabgere, Shylaja SS
  - **institution:** PES University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15510
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes GGRS, a server-side framework that regulates client updates in federated GNNs based on geometric criteria to preserve the coherence of relational transformations during global aggregation. It concludes that this geometry-aware approach is necessary to maintain effective message-passing in heterogeneous, cross-domain federated graph learning settings.

- **[arXiv260218] Service Orchestration in the Computing Continuum: Structural Challenges and Vision**
  - **tags:** [sys], [service orchestration], [computing continuum, edge computing, cloud computing, active inference, quality of experience, simulation environments]
  - **authors:** Boris Sedlak, Víctor Casamayor Pujol, Ildefons Magrans de Abril, Praveen Kumar Donta, Adel N. Toosi, Schahram Dustdar
  - **institution:** Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Stockholm University, University of Melbourne, ICREA, TU Wien
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15794
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper analyzes structural challenges for service orchestration in the Computing Continuum and proposes a vision for autonomous orchestration, using Active Inference as a potential approach. It concludes that no existing solution fully meets the vision and identifies key challenges, most notably the need for standardized simulation and evaluation environments to compare orchestration mechanisms.

- **[arXiv260218] Distributed Semi-Speculative Parallel Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation**
  - **tags:** [sys], [high-performance computing, mesh adaptation], [distributed memory, speculative execution, anisotropic mesh adaptation, parallel runtime system, cc-NUMA]
  - **authors:** Kevin Garner, Polykarpos Thomadakis, Nikos Chrisochoides
  - **institution:** Old Dominion University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15204
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a distributed memory method for anisotropic mesh adaptation that separates meshing functionality from performance aspects, using a shared memory mesh generator and a parallel runtime system. It avoids collective communication by first adapting interface elements on a single node and then adapting interior elements in parallel while keeping interfaces frozen. The method is shown to generate meshes of up to about 1 billion elements with quality and performance comparable to state-of-the-art HPC meshing software.

- **[arXiv260218] SCENE OTA-FD: Self-Centering Noncoherent Estimator for Over-the-Air Federated Distillation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [over-the-air federated distillation, noncoherent energy aggregation, constant-envelope signaling, self-centering estimator, pilot-free aggregation]
  - **authors:** Hao Chen, Zavareh Bozorgasl
  - **institution:** Boise State University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15326
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces SCENE, a pilot-free, noncoherent method for aggregating soft labels in over-the-air federated distillation by mapping them to transmit energies and using a self-centering estimator at the server. It eliminates the need for per-round channel state information and pilots, trading a modest variance increase for hardware-friendly transmission. The method can outperform coherent designs when pilot overhead is significant, particularly in short-coherence or hardware-constrained regimes.

- **[arXiv260218] Co-Design and Evaluation of a CPU-Free MPI GPU Communication Abstraction and Implementation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [cluster infrastructure], [MPI, GPU communication, CPU-free communication, HPE Slingshot 11, stream-triggered communication, halo exchange, Cabana/Kokkos]
  - **authors:** Patrick G. Bridges, Derek Schafer, Jack Lange, James B. White III, Anthony Skjellum, Evan Suggs, Thomas Hines, Purushotham Bangalore, Matthew G. F. Dosanjh, Whit Schonbein
  - **institution:** University of New Mexico, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee Tech University, University of Alabama, Sandia National Laboratories
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15356
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces an MPI-based GPU communication API designed to enable CPU-free, high-performance data transfer by leveraging HPE Slingshot 11 network capabilities and integrating with the Cabana/Kokkos framework. The approach reduces synchronization overhead and improves latency, as demonstrated on the Frontier and Tuolumne supercomputers. Results show up to a 50% reduction in medium message latency and a 28% speedup in halo-exchange benchmarks at scale.
