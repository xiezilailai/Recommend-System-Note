  - **authors:** Antonio Cruciani, Avinandan Das, Alesya Raevskaya, Jukka Suomela
  - **institution:** Aalto University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18188
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper shows that the family of Locally Checkable Labeling (LCL) problems is highly robust by proving that even a very restricted version (node-edge checkable on regular unlabeled graphs) can be translated to and from the standard LCL definition with minimal overhead. This translation uses local reductions requiring only a symmetry-breaking oracle, incurring at most an additive O(log* n) rounds in the LOCAL model. The main conclusion is that counterintuitive properties of LCLs are inherent and not artifacts of the specific definition, as they persist even in this restricted formalism.

- **[arXiv260224] The Category Mistake of Cislunar Time: Why NASA Cannot Synchronize What Doesn't Exist**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed systems, time synchronization], [Coordinated Lunar Time, category mistake, ontic vs epistemic, atomic clocks, relativistic corrections, LunaNet, Forward-In-Time-Only, Leibnizian operationalism, fine-tuning argument]

  - **institution:** DÆDÆLUS
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18641
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper critiques NASA's plan to establish Coordinated Lunar Time by arguing it commits a philosophical category mistake, treating synchronized time as an independent ontic entity rather than an epistemic, model-dependent construct. It applies concepts from quantum foundations, such as Spekkens' operationalism and the ontic/epistemic distinction, to show the program's conceptual incoherence and proposes a transactional alternative based on bilateral atomic interactions.

- **[arXiv260224] Asymptotic Subspace Consensus in Dynamic Networks**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed computing], [asymptotic subspace consensus, convex hull, oblivious message adversaries, dynamic networks]

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.19121
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces the problem of asymptotic subspace consensus, a relaxation of traditional asymptotic consensus where processes' outputs converge to a common subspace rather than a single point. It provides a complete characterization of solvability under oblivious message adversaries and shows that many existing consensus algorithms degrade gracefully to this weaker problem in dynamic networks. The work also analyzes the rate at which the dimension of agreement is reduced.

- **[arXiv260224] What Distributed Computing Got Wrong: The Category Mistake That Turned Design Choices into Laws of Nature**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed computing], [FITO, category mistake, impossibility theorems, bilateral transactions, ontic/epistemic distinction]
  - **authors:** Paul Borrill
  - **institution:** DÆDÆLUS
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18723
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper argues that foundational impossibility results in distributed computing (like FLP and CAP) are not physical laws but consequences of the design choice of Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) information flow. By applying a category mistake framework and Spekkens' Leibnizian principle, it shows these limits are specific to FITO systems and proposes bilateral transactional interactions as an alternative. The conclusion is that distributed computing has been optimizing within an unnecessarily constrained design space.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces WANSpec, a method that leverages under-utilized global compute resources for LLM inference by offloading the draft model of speculative decoding to remote data centers over a wide area network. This approach reduces the forward passes of the draft model in high-demand data centers by over 50% while maintaining low latency through judicious redundancy. The core conclusion is that WANSpec can effectively mitigate GPU capacity constraints and augment cloud providers by utilizing distributed, heterogeneous compute resources.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a semantic platform for managing Industrial IoT data streams by unifying heterogeneous sources into a Knowledge Graph and using Apache Kafka/Flink for real-time processing. It combines semantic models with context-aware reasoning (SPARQL/SWRL) for dynamic stream discovery and access control. The experimental evaluation concludes that this approach enables flexible and interoperable data workflows for Industry 5.0 environments.
