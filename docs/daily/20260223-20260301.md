- **[arXiv260223] It's Not Just Timestamps: A Study on Docker Reproducibility**
  - **tags:** [sys], [container security], [reproducible builds, Dockerfile, software supply chain, bitwise reproducibility, container images]
  - **authors:** Oreofe Solarin

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents new parallel batch-dynamic algorithms for maintaining a low out-degree orientation of an undirected graph. The algorithms achieve polylogarithmic depth and improve upon prior work by reducing the work per edge update, offering results with asymptotically optimal expected work, worst-case work matching the best sequential algorithm, and a significant improvement for maintaining a near-optimal orientation.

- **[arXiv260223] Closing Africa's Early Warning Gap: AI Weather Forecasting for Disaster Prevention**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [cluster infrastructure], [NVIDIA Earth-2, PostgreSQL, ProcessPoolExecutor, aiobotocore, async Python, database-backed serving, coordinate management, WhatsApp distribution]
  - **authors:** Qness Ndlovu
  - **institution:** Dimension Research Lab
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17726
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a low-cost, production-grade architecture using NVIDIA Earth-2 AI weather models and PostgreSQL caching to provide national-scale weather forecasts and early warnings in Africa. The system reduces deployment costs by over 2,000 times compared to traditional radar and delivers forecasts via WhatsApp. The main conclusion is that this architecture makes continent-scale early warning systems economically viable, which can significantly reduce disaster-related deaths.

- **[arXiv260223] GPU Memory and Utilization Estimation for Training-Aware Resource Management: Opportunities and Limitations**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [cluster infrastructure], [GPU memory estimation, GPU utilization estimation, analytical models, CPU-side libraries, ML-based estimators, Horus, PyTorch FakeTensor]
  - **authors:** Ehsan Yousefzadeh-Asl-Miandoab, Reza Karimzadeh, Danyal Yorulmaz, Bulat Ibragimov, Pınar Tözün
  - **institution:** IT University of Copenhagen, University of Copenhagen
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17817
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper systematically analyzes three paradigms for estimating GPU memory and utilization—analytical models, CPU-side libraries, and ML-based estimators—to improve resource management for collocated deep learning training. It finds key trade-offs: analytical models are hardware-dependent, CPU-side libraries are intrusive, and ML-based estimators struggle with generalization. The authors conclude that significant challenges remain in achieving accurate, generalizable, and low-overhead estimation for robust task collocation.

- **[arXiv260223] Mind the Boundary: Stabilizing Gemini Enterprise A2A via a Cloud Run Hub Across Projects and Accounts**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol, JSON-RPC, Cloud Run, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Vertex AI, authentication, orchestration]
  - **authors:** Takao Morita
  - **institution:** Independent Researcher
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17675
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper implements an A2A Hub orchestrator on Google Cloud Run to route queries across different projects and accounts for Gemini Enterprise, addressing UI compatibility and authentication challenges. The core method involves enforcing a text-only JSON-RPC mode and separating structured data into a REST API to ensure stable responses. The main conclusion is that practical multi-agent interoperability requires managing not just protocol compliance but also UI constraints and cross-boundary authentication.

- **[arXiv260223] Distributed Security: From Isolated Properties to Synergistic Trust**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed systems security], [Byzantine fault tolerance, consensus protocols, distributed agreement, data consistency, secure multi-party computation, privacy, verifiability, accountability]
  - **authors:** Minghui Xu
  - **institution:** Shandong University, Quan Cheng Laboratory
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18063
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This vision paper argues for a paradigm shift in distributed security research, moving from the isolated study of foundational properties like agreement, consistency, privacy, verifiability, and accountability towards understanding their synergistic combinations. It traces the evolution of these properties and posits that the research frontier lies at their intersections, where fusion creates new capabilities. The paper concludes that the future of distributed security is in harnessing these synergies to build a unified fabric of trust, while identifying challenges like property convergence frameworks and post-quantum threats.

- **[arXiv260223] Green by Design: Constraint-Based Adaptive Deployment in the Cloud Continuum**
  - **tags:** [sys], [cloud computing], [green constraints, adaptive orchestration, deployment plans, energy-aware scheduling, cloud-edge continuum]
  - **authors:** Andrea D'Iapico, Monica Vitali

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18287
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a methodology for automatically generating deployment plans for cloud-native applications based on dynamically learned green constraints, which consider energy consumption and infrastructure carbon intensity. This enables adaptive, energy-aware orchestration across the cloud-edge continuum. The approach is validated to effectively reduce energy usage and associated emissions in realistic deployment scenarios.

- **[arXiv260223] A reliability- and latency-driven task allocation framework for workflow applications in the edge-hub-cloud continuum**

  - **authors:** Andreas Kouloumpris, Georgios L. Stavrinides, Maria K. Michael, Theocharis Theocharides
  - **institution:** University of Cyprus, KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18158
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes an exact multi-objective task allocation framework using binary integer linear programming to jointly optimize reliability and latency for workflow applications in an edge-hub-cloud architecture. The method incorporates time redundancy and key constraints, showing significant improvements over baselines in experiments with real-world and synthetic workflows.

- **[arXiv260223] It does not matter how you define locally checkable labelings**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed graph algorithms], [locally checkable labeling, LOCAL model, round elimination, symmetry-breaking oracle, O(log* n) rounds]
  - **authors:** Antonio Cruciani, Avinandan Das, Alesya Raevskaya, Jukka Suomela
  - **institution:** Aalto University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18188
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper shows that the family of Locally Checkable Labeling (LCL) problems is highly robust by proving that even a very restricted version (node-edge checkable on regular unlabeled graphs) can be translated to and from the standard LCL definition with minimal overhead. This translation uses local reductions requiring only a symmetry-breaking oracle, incurring at most an additive O(log* n) rounds in the LOCAL model. The main conclusion is that counterintuitive properties of LCLs are inherent and not artifacts of the specific definition, as they persist even in this restricted formalism.
